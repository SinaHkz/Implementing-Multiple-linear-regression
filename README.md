In this project, I implemented a multiple linear regression model using Python. The implementation includes a detailed explanation of how multiple linear regression works, covering the underlying mathematics, assumptions, and the process of estimating coefficients. Additionally, I developed a training model to fit the data, providing insights into its performance and accuracy.
